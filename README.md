# PearMicrobes
**Microbial communities** are interesting and diverse. Some bacteria and fungi are *harmful pathogens* and some *promote good plant health*.

Orchard microbial communities are influenced by *spatial structure* (stochastic processes) and *environmental factors* as well as *farm management* practices (i.e., deterministic processes).

Here we consider the stochastic and deterministic factors that underly both bacterial and fungal community richness and evenness (alpha diversity), and we investigate the influence of these factors on specific microbes of interest in pear cultivation. We also investigate community turnover (beta diversity) across our study extent, and we partition community turnover (beta diversity) to seperately investigate the influence of land cover, climate, and farm management on abundance driven turnover compared to taxa assemblage related turnover.

## Main Messages:

1. Bacteria communities are influenced by farm managment as well as surrounding agricultural land use (Multivariate regression and model selection - % fruit orchard in surrounding landscape)

2. Fungal communities are influenced by farm managment practices as well as environmental variables (Multivariate regression and model selection, vapor pressure deficit - moisture)

3. There is not a strong influence of spatial patterning in our main pathogens and commensals of interest (1st approach - correlograms; 2nd approach - Canonical Correlation Analysis - still working on it to contrast the deterministic and stochastic factor influence on our good and bad bacteria and fungi)

4. Community turnover (whole Bac community as well as Bac community beta diversity partitioned between abundance and genera  turnover contributions) was influenced by surrounding forest for CCA, or minimum temperature for bacteria using euclidean distance RDA, but proportion of forest using bray-curtis distance for the whole community RDA... both abundance and taxa turnover were also influneced by surrounding forest (not very spatial...)

5. Community turnover (whole Fungal community as well as fungal community beta diversity partitioned between abundance and genera  turnover contributions) was influenced by vapor pressure deficit (moisture) using euclidean distance, and minimum temperature and elevation using bray-curtis distance (very not spatial...). Abundance related turnover was spatially autocorrelated and related to proportion of forest, while taxa related turnover was related to minimum temperature and elevation
